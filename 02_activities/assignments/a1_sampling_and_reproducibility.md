# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

The whitby_covid_tracing.py file contains a simulation model that evaluates how contact tracing might bias the perceived sources of COVID-19 infections. Here's an analysis of the sampling procedures within the model:

Stages of Sampling

1. Initial Population Setup:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: A DataFrame ppl is created with 1,000 individuals, where 200 attend weddings and 800 attend brunches.
Sample Size: 1,000 individuals
Sampling Frame: Attendees of weddings and brunches

2. Infection Sampling:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: A random subset of the population is infected based on the ATTACK_RATE (10%). This uses the np.random.choice function to select infected individuals.
Sample Size: 10% of 1,000 individuals (100 individuals)
Underlying Distribution: Uniform distribution over the entire population, since each individual has an equal probability of being infected.

3. Primary Contact Tracing:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: Among the infected individuals, a random selection is traced based on the TRACE_SUCCESS rate (20%). This uses the np.random.rand function to decide if an infected person is traced.
Sample Size: 20% of infected individuals (approximately 20 individuals)
Underlying Distribution: Bernoulli distribution with success probability equal to TRACE_SUCCESS.

4. Secondary Contact Tracing:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: If the number of traced individuals at a specific event type exceeds the SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD (2), all infected attendees of that event are considered traced.
Sample Size: Variable, dependent on the number of traced individuals per event type exceeding the threshold.
Underlying Distribution: Conditional on the primary tracing results.

Relation to the Blog Post
The blog post discusses how contact tracing might overrepresent certain events (e.g., weddings) due to easier traceability compared to other settings (e.g., private gatherings). The simulation reflects this by showing that even with equal infection rates, the perceived sources of infections can be skewed. This is modeled by:

The uniform infection rate across events.
The random success rate of primary contact tracing.
The threshold-based secondary tracing, which amplifies the visibility of events with more traced individuals.

Summary
The sampling procedures in the code are designed to simulate the potential biases introduced by contact tracing:
Initial Population Sampling: Sets up a structured population of event attendees.
Infection Sampling: Randomly infects a proportion of individuals.
Primary Tracing Sampling: Randomly traces a proportion of infected individuals.
Secondary Tracing Sampling: Applies additional tracing based on event-specific thresholds.
These steps collectively simulate how certain events might appear as more significant sources of infection due to the mechanics of contact tracing, aligning with the points raised in the blog post.



The code successfully reproduces the essential findings from Andrew Whitby's blog post. The histograms show that weddings are overrepresented in the traced cases compared to their actual infection rates, demonstrating the bias introduced by the contact tracing process. The visualizations align well with those presented in the original blog post, confirming that the code effectively models the described phenomenon.



Comment on the reproducibility of the results:
Observations on Reproducibility
Consistency in Trends:

Across multiple runs with 1,000 repetitions, the overall trend remains consistent. The proportion of traced cases attributed to weddings (red) consistently peaks higher than the proportion of infections attributed to weddings (blue). This aligns with the expected bias in contact tracing.
Variation in Distributions:

Despite the consistent trend, there are noticeable variations in the specific shapes and peaks of the histograms. This is due to the reduced number of repetitions (1,000 compared to 50,000 in the original simulation), which increases the variability in the sampled outcomes.
Implications of Reduced Sample Size:

With fewer repetitions, the results are more sensitive to random fluctuations. While the main findings (overrepresentation of weddings in traced cases) remain evident, the exact proportions can vary more significantly between runs.
Increasing the number of repetitions would reduce this variability, leading to more stable and reproducible results.
Conclusion
The simulation with 1,000 repetitions demonstrates the key findings consistently but with greater variability than the original 50,000 repetitions. This highlights the importance of a larger sample size in simulations to achieve more reproducible and stable outcomes. â€‹


Changes Made for Reproducibility:
Global Random Seed: np.random.seed(10) is set at the beginning of the script to ensure that all random processes (like event infection and tracing) produce the same results each time the script is executed.

Parameterized Repetitions: The number of repetitions (num_repetitions) is passed to the run_simulation_and_plot function, ensuring that the number of simulations conducted can be easily adjusted without modifying the simulation logic itself.

These changes ensure that when you run the script multiple times, you will get identical simulation results, which is essential for reproducibility in scientific simulations and experiments.
